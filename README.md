# 🎮 Project-15: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## 🧩 Overview

**Tic-Tac-Toe Game** is a classic two-player desktop application version of the well-known paper-and-pencil game. Players alternate turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid, aiming to get three of their symbols ("X" or "O") in a row — vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

This simple yet engaging project provides a fun way to play Tic-Tac-Toe in a Windows desktop environment.
