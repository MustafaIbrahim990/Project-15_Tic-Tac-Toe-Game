## Overview
This project, **"Tic-Tac-Toe Game,"** is a classic two-player desktop application that recreates the popular paper-and-pencil game. Players alternate placing "X" and "O" marks on a 3x3 grid aiming to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before their opponent. It provides an engaging and easy-to-use interface for playing Tic-Tac-Toe on Windows.
